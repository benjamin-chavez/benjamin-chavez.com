To learn more about Next.js 13 and React Server Components, I recently rebuilt my website with the framework and its new App Router. In doing so, I expanded the site to include a technical blog section where I can write about the different technologies I am working with.

I just finished a new post that details how to use Next.js App Router, Express.js, and Auth0 to build a secure, scalable web application with server-side rendering. The post covers Next.js features like rewrites and middleware, and how to utilize these features to implement fullstack auth.

By combining these technologies, you get the benefits of SSR and optimization from Next.js along with the flexibility of Express and easy proven security with Auth0.

If you are interested in learning more about Next.js, Express.js, or Auth0, I encourage you to check out my blog post: [https://benjamin-chavez.com/blog/integrating-next.js-with-express.js-using-auth0-for-authentication]

To expand my developer portfolio and add a technical blog, I rebuilt my site using Next.js 13 and its new App Router. This allowed me to integrate Express.js on the backend and implement authentication with Auth0.

I wrote a blog post detailing how to leverage Next.js, Express, and Auth0 to build a secure, scalable web app with server-side rendering. It covers topics like Next.js rewrites, middleware, and integrating Auth0 for authentication.

By combining these technologies, you get the benefits of SSR and optimization from Next.js along with the flexibility of Express and easy authentication with Auth0.

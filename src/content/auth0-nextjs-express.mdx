In this post I am going to walk you through the process of integrating a Next.js 13 (Next.js App directory) frontend with a custom backend Express.js server API. In this code I will be using Auth0 for authentication, but the process will be similar for other auth providers.

Between Vercel's push towards serverless functions (No worries, I'm still vercel fanboy...), and the seemingly widespread adoption of tRPC by much of the Typescript community, I have found that the documentation on how to integrate your own backend API with the new Next.js app directory to be a bit sparse.

Now in many cases, if you are using Next.js with Typescript, it probably makes sense to use serverless functions and if you want full type-safety, then it would make sense to use tRPC too.

However, in my case, there were a few reasons why I didn't want to use serverless or tRPC:

1. I honestly just wanted more practice with writing backend APIs.
2. I have yet to determine if this is unfounded, but I didn't really feel like working around cold starts as I expect my user base to start small and grow over time.
3. If my application does gain traction, I didn't want to lock myself into using Typescript+node.js just because I implemented the MVP using tRPC.

With that said, I do intend on learning those technologies in the future and advise you also have some good reasons if you are going to build your application with your own API server.

I am going to assume that you have some basic knowledge of Next.js, Express.js, and that you have an Auth0 account set up. If not, here are some helpful resources to get you to that point:

- Express.js:
  - [Step-by-step Guide: Setting Up An Express.js Typescript Web App](https://benjamin-chavez.com/blog/step-by-step-guide-setting-up-expressjs-typescript-web-app/)
- Next.js + auth0:
  - [A Comprehensive Guide to Next.js Authentication with Auth0](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-next-js-authentication-with-auth0-c5af1e472fdb)
  - [Add Login to your Next.js application](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs/interactive)

Now, if you want to code along, you can find the starter code here: [GITHUBLINK](TODO:).

In this example, I will have the express server stored in a `server` folder and the Next.js app in a `client` folder. I will be running them indivdually in their own terminals, but in a real project you will likely want to use something like [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) or [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/repo) so that you can run the two applications in parallel from the same terminal.

## Start Application

Open two separate terminals and start the frontend in one and the backend in the other:

Start Next.js frontend App

```bash
cd client
pnpm dev
```

Start Express.js backend Server

```bash
cd server
pnpm start
```

Now, if you open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and [http://localhost:5000/api](http://localhost:5000/api), you will see the following:

<Image
  src="/img/blog/auth0-nextjs-express/ss1.png"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Screenshot"
/>

## Declare Rewrites

In Next.js a Rewrite allows us to redirect any incoming navigation or client requests.

We are going to use [Next.js rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) to map all incoming api requests over to our express server.

Now, with both your frontend and backend running, go to [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api) in your browser. You will see a `404 page not found` error.

Stop your frontend server and add the following code to your `client/next.config.js` file.

```js:client/next.config.js {3-10} showLineNumbers
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/api/:path*',
        destination: 'http://localhost:5000/api/:path*',
      },
    ];
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

Start up your frontend server again and go back to go to [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api) in your browser.

The `404` should be gone, and you should now see `Server Running...`:

<Image
  src="/img/blog/auth0-nextjs-express/ss3.png"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Screenshot"
/>

This message is coming directly from your express server because our request to `http://localhost:3000/api` has been mapped over to `http://localhost:5000/api`.

## Add Next.js Middlware

Rather than requiring authentication in each of our private pages or components, we will be implementing [Next.js Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware), which will allow us to specify the specific routes that we want to make private.

{/* TODO: Cleanup */}
There are several benefits to this approach. The first is that it will allow us to keep authentication and authorization handled client-side. This is as opposed to handling auth server-side in our express server. If we were to have the auth happen in our server, then we would be sending requests each time a user navigated to a new page and then we would have to wait for our server response before allowing the user to continue. You can imagine how this might become problematic.

This approach allows us to keep our auth logic separate from our other applcation logic. This separation of concerns is a good design choice in that the modulatity reduces cognitive load and if later we decide to change auth managers, we only have to update one file as opposed to having to update every private page/component.

1. Create a new `client/src/middleware.ts` file and add the following contents:

```ts:client/src/middleware.ts {} showLineNumbers
import { withMiddlewareAuthRequired } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0/edge';

export default withMiddlewareAuthRequired();

export const config = {
  matcher: '/:path*',
};
```

If you open your browser back to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), you will be automatically redirected to the auth0 login screen.

<Image
  src="/img/blog/auth0-nextjs-express/ss2.png"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Screenshot"
/>

This is because we have effectively protected all routes. The `withMiddlewareAuthRequired()` tells Next.js and Auth0 to require authentication for all requests passing through the middleware and the `matcher: '/:path*',` tells Next.js which route requests need to pass through the middleware, in our case all of them.

If you login, you will again have access to all of the pages of our application.

2. Define protected routes

Now, we don't actually want to make the whole app private, so let's update our `matcher` pattern as follows:

```ts:client/src/middleware.ts {6} showLineNumbers
import { withMiddlewareAuthRequired } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0/edge';

export default withMiddlewareAuthRequired();

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/private/:path*', '/api/:path*'],
};
```

If you log out and go back to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), you should once again be able to access both our `Home` and `Public` pages. Additionally, if you navigate to [http://localhost:3000/private](http://localhost:3000/private), you will be redirected to our login screen.

**NOTE**: TODO: Next.js middlware only runs on navigated routes and API requests from client components. You cannot access the Next.js middleware from server components.

## Protecting Our API Routes

If you navigate back to [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api), you will notice that you need to be logged in to see our `Server Running...` response. This is because we passed our API routes to our middleware matcher with `'/api/:path*'`.

This is important because it stops unauthorized users from bypassing our security simply by hitting our api routes instead of our frontend UI.

However, there is still a massive security flaw in our design. If you navigate to [http://localhost:5000/api](http://localhost:5000/api), you will see that our route isn't actually protected.

We know this because we are able to see the `Server Running...` response.

To remedy this, we need to add Authentication to the route directly in our Backend express API.

1. In you Express.js server directory install the following npm packages:

```bash
#  ENSURE YOU ARE IN YOUR SERVER DIRECTORY
cd server
pnpm i express-jwt jwks-rsa
```

2. Create this middleware file `server/src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts` in your backend.

```ts:server/src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts showLineNumbers
import 'dotenv/config';

import { GetVerificationKey, expressjwt as jwt } from 'express-jwt';
import jwksRsa from 'jwks-rsa';
const issuerBaseUrl = process.env.AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL;
const audience = process.env.AUTH0_AUDIENCE || 'http://localhost:5000/';

export const checkJwt = jwt({
  secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({
    cache: true,
    rateLimit: true,
    jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
    jwksUri: `${issuerBaseUrl}/.well-known/jwks.json`,
  }) as GetVerificationKey,
  audience: audience,
  issuer: `${issuerBaseUrl}/`,
  algorithms: ['RS256'],
});
```

We will use this auth middleware in our backend to decrypt `JWT Authentication Tokens` that our express server recieves from our Next.js frontend.

3. In your `server/src/app.ts` file import the auth middleware and add it your api route:

```ts:src/app.ts {1, 4} showLineNumbers
import { checkJwt } from './middleware/authMiddleware';
...

app.use('/api', checkJwt, routes);
...
```

If we open back up to [http://localhost:5000/api](http://localhost:5000/api), we will see that our backend api routes are now protected as well.

## Securely passing Auth Tokens

So far, this is great, we have both our frontend and backend protected. The only problem is that now we have to pass auth tokens to our API to gain access to our protected routes.

This is easy if we are making requests from a server component, we just get the auth token from our session and pass it with the request:

```tsx:example-server-component.tsx showLineNumbers
// THIS IS EXAMPLE CODE ONLY AND WILL NOT USED IN OUR APPLICATION
import { getAccessToken } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0';

export async function getMyProducts() {
  const { accessToken } = await getAccessToken();

  const res = await fetch(`http://localhost:5000/api`, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    },
  });

  return res.json();
}
```

The issue is that client components cannot use `getAccessToken()`. We could, get the access token in a server component and pass it as props to our client component. That would work, but it isn't the most secure solution as we would be sending the auth token to the client.

The solution is to add the authToken to our API Request's headers in our frontend middleware before `rewriting` our requests to our backend API.

To set this up we will need to create a request that we can attach our authentication token to, because up to now we have been making requests manually in our browser.

1. Convert out `Private` page to a client component by adding the `'use client';` directive to the top of the file.

```tsx:client/src/app/private/page.tsx {1} showLineNumbers
'use client';
```

2. Import the `useState` hook and write a `callApi()` function to fetch data from our Express server.

```tsx:client/src/app/private/page.tsx {3-35} showLineNumbers
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function PrivatePage() {
  const [state, setState] = useState({
    isLoading: false,
    response: undefined,
    error: undefined,
  });

  const callApi = async () => {
    setState((previous) => ({ ...previous, isLoading: true }));

    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/routes');
      const data = await response.json();

      setState((previous) => ({
        ...previous,
        response: data,
        error: undefined,
      }));
    } catch (error) {
      setState((previous) => ({
        ...previous,
        response: undefined,
        error,
      }));
    } finally {
      setState((previous) => ({ ...previous, isLoading: false }));
    }
  };

  const { isLoading, response, error } = state;
  ...
}
```

3. Add a button to initiate API requests

```tsx:client/src/app/private/page.tsx {1, 8-12} showLineNumbers
    return (
      <>
        <h1 className="mt-10 text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white sm:text-6xl">
          Private Page
        </h1>

        <button
          onClick={callApi}
          className="block rounded hover:opacity-70 text-white bg-pink-800/50 px-2 py-1 mt-10"
        >
          Call API
        </button>
      </>
    );
```

4. Ensure we are not in a `loading state` and display the server response

```tsx:client/src/app/private/page.tsx {1, 15-17} showLineNumbers
  if (!isLoading) {
    return (
      <>
        <h1 className="mt-10 text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white sm:text-6xl">
          Private Page
        </h1>

        <button
          onClick={callApi}
          className="block rounded hover:opacity-70 text-white bg-pink-800/50 px-2 py-1 mt-10"
        >
          Call API
        </button>

        <div className="mt-20">
          {response && <div>{JSON.stringify(response)}</div>}
        </div>
      </>
    );
  }
```

Your fully updated `Private` page should look like this:

```tsx:client/src/app/private/page.tsx {} showLineNumbers
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function PrivatePage() {
  const [state, setState] = useState({
    isLoading: false,
    response: undefined,
    error: undefined,
  });

  const callApi = async () => {
    setState((previous) => ({ ...previous, isLoading: true }));

    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/routes');
      const data = await response.json();

      setState((previous) => ({
        ...previous,
        response: data,
        error: undefined,
      }));
    } catch (error) {
      setState((previous) => ({
        ...previous,
        response: undefined,
        error,
      }));
    } finally {
      setState((previous) => ({ ...previous, isLoading: false }));
    }
  };

  const { isLoading, response, error } = state;

  if (!isLoading) {
    return (
      <>
        <h1 className="mt-10 text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white sm:text-6xl">
          Private Page
        </h1>

        <button
          onClick={callApi}
          className="mt-10 block rounded bg-pink-800/50 px-2 py-1 text-white hover:opacity-70"
        >
          Call API
        </button>

        <div className="mt-20">
          {response && <div>{JSON.stringify(response)}</div>}
        </div>
      </>
    );
  }
}
```

### Set Authentication Headers

Next, we will want to add our authentication token to the headers of our private request as it passes through our middleware.

1. Create a middlware function that takes in a `NextRequest` object, copies the existing headers over to a new `NextResponse` object, and returns that `NextResponse` object:

```ts:client/src/middleware.ts {1-11} showLineNumbers
export default withMiddlewareAuthRequired(function middleware(
  req: NextRequest,
) {
  const response = NextResponse.next({
    request: {
      headers: new Headers(req.headers),
    },
  });

  return response;
});
```

2. Import `getSession` to get our user session and auth token from Auth0

```ts:client/src/middleware.ts {1, 6, 15-16} showLineNumbers
import { getSession, withMiddlewareAuthRequired } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0/edge';

...

// Be sure to add the `async` modifier to your function
export default withMiddlewareAuthRequired(async function middleware(
  req: NextRequest
) {
  const response = NextResponse.next({
    request: {
      headers: new Headers(req.headers),
    },
  });

  const user = await getSession(req, response);
  const token = user?.accessToken;

  return response;
});
...
```

3. Set the Authorization header in our newly created `NextResponse` object:

```ts {3} showLineNumbers
const token = user?.accessToken;

response.headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);

return response;
```

The fully updated middleware will look like this:

```ts:client/src/middleware.ts showLineNumbers
import {
  getSession,
  withMiddlewareAuthRequired,
} from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0/edge';
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export default withMiddlewareAuthRequired(async function middleware(
  req: NextRequest,
) {
  const response = NextResponse.next({
    request: {
      headers: new Headers(req.headers),
    },
  });

  const user = await getSession(req, response);
  const token = user?.accessToken;

  response.headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);

  return response;
});

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/private/:path*', '/api/:path*'],
};
```

Now, if we go to our private page and click our `Call API` button, we will see the response data object being displayed on our `Private` page:
